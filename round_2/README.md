## Manual challenge

Some shipping containers with valuables inside washed ashore. You get to choose a maximum of two containers to open and receive the valuable contents from. The first container you open is free of charge, but for the second one you will have to pay some SeaShells. Keep in mind that you are not the only one choosing containers and making a claim on its contents. You will have to split the spoils with all others that choose the same container. So, choose carefully.

Here's a breakdown of how your profit from a container will be computed:
Every container has its **treasure multiplier** (up to 90) and number of **inhabitants** (up to 10) that will be choosing that particular container. The container’s total treasure is the product of the **base treasure** (10 000, same for all containers) and the container’s specific treasure multiplier. However, the resulting amount is then divided by the sum of the inhabitants that choose the same container and the percentage of opening this specific container of the total number of times a container has been opened (by all players).

For example, if **5 inhabitants** choose a container, and **this container was chosen** **10% of the total number of times a container has been opened** (by all players), the prize you get from that container will be divided by 15. After the division, **costs for opening a container** apply (if there are any), and profit is what remains.

10 fully stocked shipping containers washed ashore. Now we have to share the loot with all the teams. Each container holds items worth at least 10.000 seashells, but many containers are worth far more, indicated by a loot multiplier. We can open up 1 or 2 containers. The first one is free but the second has a small fee. I will share the container contents with all inhabitants and players who choose the same one. Fortunately the inhabitants are predictable. you will clearly see which containers they want, the other players are a different story their choices remain a mistery until I choose mine.
Your goal is to choose up to two containers and take home the most treasure. Each container is said to hold at least 10.000 SeaShells, but multipliers on the outside of the containers hint a much bigger rewards. Select your preferred container(s) by clicking on them. There might be costs involved in opening these containers and you are not the only one looking for treasure. So choose your container(s) thoughtfully

Use the map of the beach to choose your container(s), by clicking on the preferred container(s). Your chosen container(s) will appear below the map of the beach. As soon as you’re happy with your choice, make sure to submit your manual trade by clicking the submit button.
